# Definition

- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move toward the beginning end or middle based on a certain condition.
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

# Description

- Usually involving some sort of linear structure like an array or string, or a double/single linked list.
- Usually a search for a pair of values that match a condition.
- Often using two index (pointer) references in various directions.
- Also see two pointer technique and the source of some of these problems can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/learn/lecture/11183942#overview).
