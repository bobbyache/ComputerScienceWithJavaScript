# Problem Solving approach

> **Note:** many of these strategies are adapted from George Polya, whose book How To Solve It is a great resource.

## Problem Solving Strategies

- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look back and refactor

## Undertand the problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined by the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's ok; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage).

## Explore Concrete Examples

- Start with simple examples.
- Progress to more complex examples.
- Explore examples with empty and invalid inputs.

## Break it Down

- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
- This forces you to think about the code before you write it.
- Helps catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in to the details.
- Don't get strung up on language syntax.

## Solve/Simplify

- Solve the problem... or if you can't... **solve a simpler problem**.
- Find the core difficulty and temporarily ignore it.
- Write a simplified solution.
- Incorporate the difficulty in later.

## Look Back and Refactor

- Congrats on solving it, but you're not done!
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?
